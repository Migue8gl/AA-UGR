# AA-UGR
Repository for the subject Machine Learning (Aprendizaje Autom√°tico) in Computer Engineering's Degree at the UGR

- Contains:
  - Text file that contains answers to the questions of the questionnaires and exams.
  - Practices:
    - **P0**: practical bonus to learn how to handle python, especially its numpy and matplotlib libraries.
    - **P1**: implementation of the stochastic gradient descent and linear regression algorithm. We use linear functions applying non-linearity to solve problems that with linearity would not have been solved.
    - **P2**: We study the complexity of function classes and noise. In addition, we program the PLA algorithm and compare it with other linear algorithms.
    - **P3**: We solve a problem with the acquired knowledge. It goes through the entire process of data preprocessing, function class selection, training, etc.
